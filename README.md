# Humane Touch
 
Exam Project for Playable Media 24

The project focuses on dealing with toxicity and negative discourse in gaming communities. It uses A.I to have feedback on player behaviour to help them consider their actions. However, the A.I part is just a demo, not working as imagined due to the scope limitations for the exam.

To run the application, Python 3.11.9 is required.

Then "pip install -r requirements.txt" would install the required dependencies.
